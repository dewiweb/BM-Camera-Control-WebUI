# Development Plan for BM Camera Control WebUI

## Overview
This document outlines the planned implementations for enhancing the BM Camera Control WebUI based on the existing API functionalities and the identified unimplemented features.

## Planned Implementations

### 1. Color Correction UI Enhancement
- **Objective:** Develop a user-friendly interface for color correction features.
- **Related YAML Document:** `ColorCorrectionControl.yaml`
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement the `setCCMode` function to toggle between color correction modes (Lift, Gamma, Gain).
  - Create UI elements for each color correction parameter (Lift, Gamma, Gain, Offset, Contrast) with sliders and input fields.
  - Connect UI elements to respective API endpoints to allow real-time adjustments.

### 2. Audio Settings Integration
- **Objective:** Add audio control functionalities to the web interface.
- **Related YAML Document:** `AudioControl.yaml`
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify relevant audio control API endpoints (e.g., audio input, levels).
  - Create UI elements for managing audio settings (input selection, levels).
  - Implement JavaScript functions to handle audio settings adjustments and API interactions.

### 3. Codec/Format Switching
- **Objective:** Enable users to switch between different codec and format settings.
- **Related YAML Document:** `SystemControl.yaml`
- **Tasks:**
  - Review API documentation for codec/format endpoints.
  - Design UI components for codec and format selection.
  - Implement functions to handle codec/format switching and integrate with the existing UI.

### 4. Improved UI Responsiveness
- **Objective:** Enhance the web interface's responsiveness across various devices.
- **Related YAML Document:** N/A
- **Tasks:**
  - Review current CSS styles and layout structures.
  - Implement responsive design principles using CSS media queries.
  - Test the UI on different devices and screen sizes to ensure optimal performance.

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Objective:** Improve error handling mechanisms throughout the application.
- **Related YAML Document:** N/A
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify areas where error handling can be improved (e.g., API requests, UI interactions).
  - Implement user-friendly error messages and logging for debugging.
  - Ensure that the application can gracefully handle network issues and API errors.

### 6. Save/Download Preset Files
- **Objective:** Allow users to save and download preset files from/to the camera.
- **Related YAML Document:** `PresetControl.yaml`
- **Tasks:**
  - Review API endpoints related to preset management.
  - Implement UI components for saving and downloading presets.
  - Create JavaScript functions to handle preset file operations and integrate with the existing API.

### 7. Lens Control Integration
- **Objective:** Integrate lens control functionalities into the web interface.
- **Related YAML Document:** `LensControl.yaml`
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify relevant lens control API endpoints (e.g., focus, zoom).
  - Create UI elements for managing lens settings.
  - Implement JavaScript functions to handle lens adjustments and API interactions.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Implement Color Correction UI and Audio Settings Integration.
- **Week 3:** Develop Codec/Format Switching and Improved UI Responsiveness.
- **Week 4:** Enhance Error Handling and implement Save/Download Preset Files functionality.
- **Week 5:** Integrate Lens Control functionalities.

## Conclusion
This development plan aims to enhance the functionality and usability of the BM Camera Control WebUI, enabling users to have a comprehensive control experience for their Blackmagic cameras.
